  * AJPH -- nothing found
* **Sociology**
  * American Sociological Association Code of Ethics:
    > "As a regular practice, sociologists share data and pertinent documentation as an integral
part of a research plan. Sociologists generally make their data available after completion of
a project or its major publications, except where proprietary agreements with employers,
contractors, or clients preclude such accessibility or when it is impossible to share data and
protect the confidentiality of the research participants (e.g., field notes or detailed
information from ethnographic interviews)." (p. 16)
* **Economics** 
  * [Data and Code Availability Standard (economics journals)](https://datacodestandard.org/journals/)
* **General & Other**
  * [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/author-center/editorial-and-journal-policies#materials-and-data-availability)
  * [PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods)
